# Guidelines for Submitting Documents
## General Guidelines 
- Please submit a markdown document that contains all your code and answers. 
- This document should be created by a `.Rmd` file that we can execute that produces all answers, without error. 
- You do not need to show work for trivial calculations, but showing work is always allowed.
- For answers that involve a narrative response, please feel free to describe the key concept directly and briefly, if you can do so, and do not feel pressure to go on at length.
- Please ask us questions about the problem set if you get stuck. *Donâ€™t spend more than 20 minutes puzzling over what a problem means.* 
- Please ensure that someone (us!) can compile your solution set. The best way is to use the web-hosted links we've provided. 
- For text answers, please **embolden** your answers to the questions.
- For computing answers, please store them in the answer objects we have created. 
- Use inline code evaluation to write your answers.

# Working Collaboratively
We (all!) come from a PhD program where all of the students (now
faculty @ UCB, Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, UofMichigan, UT-Austin)
worked together to make everyone better. We think that the
*collaborative* model  is a fantastic model, and We want to bring it
forward into this class. Talk with your friends, work together on
homework, create study groups. We _promise_ that you will learn more
from your friends and classmates than the instructors.

However, collaboration does not mean:

- free-riding on your classmates;
- sending code without conversation, and especially, 
- downloading solutions from past semesters.

If you have a question of whether what you're doing is collaborative
or not, consider whether the person or thing on the other end of the
collaboration could benefit in some form. If the answer is no, or it
is murky, then it is not collaboration. 

In particular, We bet you can find a solution set for each of these
problem sets with enough looking around. Heck, if you want, We'll tell
you where they are.

*But, don't.*

Use this as a chance to learn.
