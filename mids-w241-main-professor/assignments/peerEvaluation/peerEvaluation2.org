* Peer Evaluation 2 
Please provide us a final debrief of how your team worked together. 

- What were the components of your group project where your group (as a whole) learned the most? 
- What were the components of your group project where you (individually) learned the most?
- In your first peer evaluation, you noted your team's strengths, as well as its areas for improvement. Did you improve in these areas? Did you stay strong in your strengths?
- If there are any individual performances that deserve special recognition, please let me know in this evaluation. As well, if there are any individual performances that require special attention, please also let me know. I will treat these reviews as confidential and will not take any action without first consulting you.
