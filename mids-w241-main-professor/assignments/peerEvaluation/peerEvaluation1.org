Length: 1-2 short paragraphs

- Please let us know how your final project is going.
- Take a moment to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of your team, and whether you can jointly do something to improve.  
- If there are any individual performances that deserve special recognition, please let me know in this evaluation. As well, if there are any individual performances that require special attention, please also let me know. I will treat these reviews as confidential and will not take any action without first consulting you.
