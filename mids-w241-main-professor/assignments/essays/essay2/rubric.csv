Criteria,1 (Poor),2 (Fair),3 (Good),4 (Excellent)
WRITING:  grammar | spelling | essay structure & organization | mechanics ,"Inapproporiate use of bullet points or point form throughout. Awkward sentences. Repetitive writing or rambling. Numerous errors in grammar, mechanics, spelling. Numerous issues that greatly interfere with understanding or articulation of ideas. No clear structure - introduction or conclusion missing, no cohesiveness across elements of paper.","Some inapproriate use of bullet points or point form. Several errors in grammar, mechanics, spelling. Some awkward wording. Difficult to understand, problems with clarity or articulation of ideas (reader required to make assumptions or fill in gaps). Structure is incomplete or flawed. Limited cohesiveness throughout paper. Introduction / conclusion are present, but poorly executed.","Essay is well constructed. Few errors in grammar, spelling, mechanics. Errors do not interfere with understanding. Ideas are articulated properly. Writing is concise. Introduction states main topics and arguments; provides overview and maps the paper. Conclusion provides summary of important points. ","No errors (spelling, grammar, mechanics). Well organized paper, cohesive and structurally sound essay. Structure supports and emphasizes arguments and points. Ideas are well articulated through compelling writing. Introduction states main topics and arguments; is inviting and makes the reader curious to read more. Conclusion is strong - provides summary of important points and reinforces intended takeaways. Information presented thorughout is relevant, cohesive, and presented in a logical fashion. Writing is concise and skillful."
RESEARCH QUESTION: clarity | interest | appropriate,"RQ is not clearly stated, or not stated at all. RQ does not provide a foundation for any interesting research. RQ is not a fit for scope of work or type of work for this course. Logical problems with RQ; RQ cannot be explored properly through experimental design.","RQ is poorly stated, requires further clarification, or is ambiguous. RQ focuses on a well-trodden problem space or domain without any potential novel contribution. RQ isunlikely to yield work or results that are of interest. RQ provides problematic scoping issues for research or research design - unrealistic to address.","RQ is clearly stated. RQ articulates a well-forumated problem to address through experimental design. RQ poses interesting work. Addresses a novel problem space, or is a novel question within a domain. Provides opportunity to create new knowledge and contribution through research. RQ provides opportunity for workload that is reasonable within constraints of course. RQ provides opportunity for work that is appropriate for this course with respect to methods and analysis. ","RQ is succinct and well articulated. RQ demonstrates deep understanding of topic, problem domain, and indicates analytical and original thought. RQ is well developed and indicates thought has been given to scope. RQ and problem domain is highly relevant to course content. RQ represents a problem or domain of high interest - represents a surprising or paradoxical relationship that begs further investigation, is derived from observations or compelling circumtances that have not been investigated. RQ is fascinating, makes reader want to to continue reading."
RESEARCH DESIGN: clarity | defined plan | construction  ,"Research is poorly designed, and if conducted as is, would provide little evidence to adjudicate the research question. There may be a small number of important core design problems, or a larger number of smaller problems. ","Large parts of the design are inadequately, or inappropriately conceived. The treatment assignment may not be clear, or random; the treatment that is going to be administered might be loosly defined, if at all. Units and measurement strategies ","Although much of the design is in place, there are some inconsistencies, or poinst that lack sufficient clarity to know ahead of time that the design is feasible. For example, the notion of the units of analysis might be misplaced, or the measurement system partially conceived. This design, with additional work, will probably provide insight. ","Research would provide clear, efficient, structure to generate data that answers the research question. The plan is adequately defined so that another data scientist could conduct the same analysis, and produce similar results under similar conditions.  "
"RESEARCH QUESTION: scoe. ""Does it permit you to conduct experiment within scope of course length, resources etc.?"" ","The quesion is poorly scoped. It might be so narrow that it is uninteresting, even to data scientists who might be generally interested in the investigation. Or, alternatively it might be so broad that no specific test could ever be conducted. ","While better developed than a 1, a question scope in this category is likely still much too broad or too narrow. Perhaps the question is reasonable, but not within the limitations of the course timeline or budget constraints. Questions that are scored as 2 are very likely to be useful for the purposes of this experiment. ",,"The question scope nicely meets with the goals of the course, the capabilities of the data scientists, and the resources that are at hand. Hopefully some aspects of this question will force the team to develop novel or creative solutions, rather than being able to rely upon off-the-shelf components. "
