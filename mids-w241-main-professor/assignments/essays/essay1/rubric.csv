WRITING: clarity | grammar | structure,"Inappropriate use of bullet points or point form throughout. Awkward sentences. Repetitive writing or rambling. Numerous errors in grammar, mechanics, spelling. Numerous issues that greatly interfere with understanding or articulation of ideas. No clear structure - introduction or conclusion missing, no cohesiveness across elements of paper.,","Some inappropriate use of bullet points or point form. Several errors in grammar, mechanics, spelling. Some awkward wording. Difficult to understand, problems with clarity or articulation of ideas (reader required to make assumptions or fill in gaps). Structure is incomplete or flawed. Limited cohesiveness throughout paper. Introduction / conclusion are present, but poorly executed.","Essay is well constructed. Few errors in grammar, spelling, mechanics. Errors do not interfere with understanding. Ideas are articulated properly. Writing is concise. Introduction states main topics and arguments; provides overview and maps the paper. Conclusion provides summary of important points. ","No errors (spelling, grammar, mechanics). Well organized paper, cohesive and structurally sound essay. Structure supports and emphasizes arguments and points. Ideas are well articulated through compelling writing. Introduction states main topics and arguments; is inviting and makes the reader curious to read more. Conclusion is strong - provides summary of important points and reinforces intended takeaways. Information presented throughout is relevant, cohesive, and presented in a logical fashion. Writing is concise and skillful."
FOUND ARTICLE: poses causal question | provides some answer,"The article chosen does not actually make a causal claim; it might be only a set of descriptive statistics, or have little in the way of claim or data.  ","There might be a causal question that is posed in the article the student identifies; but, then again, there might not be. Or, there might be a causal question that is posed, but there is also a GOOD EXPERIMENT that answers the causal question. ","The authors make a causal claim, but they back it up only with associational (non-experimental) data. Probably here the student has found a compelling article, but it is a typical, ""New Research Finds…""  that you can find on the front page of nearly every major news outlet. ","The authors make a causal claim, but they back it up only with associational (non-experimental) data. To be excellent, the student has found a compelling article that falls outside the typical, ""New Research Finds…""  that you can find on the front page of nearly every major news outlet. "
CAUSAL REFORMULATION: ,"The framing of the causal question is not, in fact, causal. ",,,"The framing of the causal question is clear, succinct, and has an evident relationship to a counterfactual comparison. "
EXPERIMENT DESIGN: ,"Despite being early in the course, where we expect designs to be relatively crude, there is little that is proposed that would be called an experiment. There is no intervention and no randomization to speak of. As well, there may be very little thought given to the measurement, analysis, or design. ","A fair experiment design probably has some feelings of intervention and randomization, but there are also probably several flaw in the writing about them. A concept of measurement might be brought, but it will be cursory in description.","A good experiment at this point will certainly have clear intervention and randomization schemes. As well, the outcomes that are being measured should be sufficiently clear and measurable that it would be reasonable to expect that this experiment could be successfully conducted. ","An excellent experiment holds the promise that it could be executed with a high likelihood of returning an answer to the causal question. At this point in the semester, there is no requirement that advanced design considerations be represented in the design, although the grader expects that they could be incorporated once the student has additional information. An experiment in this category need not be perfect, but it should show creativity, an exploration in the space. "
